## Main points
Methods:
* improved asexual parasitemia measurement from Saralamba 2011 PNAS?
* gametocyte model
* model fitting using Bayesian hierarchical inference
* data: 17 volunteers, innoculated 3D7 strain

Results:
* estimate sexual commitment rate: $0.54\% (0.30\% - 1.00\%)$ per replication cycle (48 hours)
* gametocyte sequestration time: $8.39 (6.54 - 10.59)$ days
* provide tools to investigate human-mosquito transmissibility

Why modeling gametocytes is important? Discrupt transmission.

Uncertainties in the biology of gametocytes:
* investment in gametocytes, i.e. what proportion of asexuals would commit sexual pathway?
* gametocytemia (gametocyte density)
* sequestration of gametocytes (not circulating in bloodstream)
* longevity of gametocytes
* difficult to study *in vitro*

Data:
* malaria therapy in neurosyphilis patients: induced fever from malaria infection helped treated syphilis. 
* volunteer infection studies (VIS) or controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies: inoculate healthy volunteers with 3D7 merozoites

*P.falciparum* strains:
* NF54: Isolate NF54 was derived from a patient living near Schipol Airport, Amsterdam, who had never left the Netherlands (Ponnudurai T, Leeuwenberg AD & Meuwissen JH., 1981 *Trop Geogr Med*).
* 3D7: Clone 3D7 was derived from NF54 by limiting dilution (Walliker D et al, 1987 *Science*).
